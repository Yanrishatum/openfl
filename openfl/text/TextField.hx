/**
 * The TextField class is used to create display objects for text display and
 * input. <ph outputclass="flexonly">You can use the TextField class to
 * perform low-level text rendering. However, in Flex, you typically use the
 * Label, Text, TextArea, and TextInput controls to process text. <ph
 * outputclass="flashonly">You can give a text field an instance name in the
 * Property inspector and use the methods and properties of the TextField
 * class to manipulate it with ActionScript. TextField instance names are
 * displayed in the Movie Explorer and in the Insert Target Path dialog box in
 * the Actions panel.
 *
 * <p>To create a text field dynamically, use the <code>TextField()</code>
 * constructor.</p>
 *
 * <p>The methods of the TextField class let you set, select, and manipulate
 * text in a dynamic or input text field that you create during authoring or
 * at runtime. </p>
 *
 * <p>ActionScript provides several ways to format your text at runtime. The
 * TextFormat class lets you set character and paragraph formatting for
 * TextField objects. You can apply Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) styles to
 * text fields by using the <code>TextField.styleSheet</code> property and the
 * StyleSheet class. You can use CSS to style built-in HTML tags, define new
 * formatting tags, or apply styles. You can assign HTML formatted text, which
 * optionally uses CSS styles, directly to a text field. HTML text that you
 * assign to a text field can contain embedded media(movie clips, SWF files,
 * GIF files, PNG files, and JPEG files). The text wraps around the embedded
 * media in the same way that a web browser wraps text around media embedded
 * in an HTML document. </p>
 *
 * <p>Flash Player supports a subset of HTML tags that you can use to format
 * text. See the list of supported HTML tags in the description of the
 * <code>htmlText</code> property.</p>

 * @event change                    Dispatched after a control value is
 *                                  modified, unlike the
 *                                  <code>textInput</code> event, which is
 *                                  dispatched before the value is modified.
 *                                  Unlike the W3C DOM Event Model version of
 *                                  the <code>change</code> event, which
 *                                  dispatches the event only after the
 *                                  control loses focus, the ActionScript 3.0
 *                                  version of the <code>change</code> event
 *                                  is dispatched any time the control
 *                                  changes. For example, if a user types text
 *                                  into a text field, a <code>change</code>
 *                                  event is dispatched after every keystroke.
 * @event link                      Dispatched when a user clicks a hyperlink
 *                                  in an HTML-enabled text field, where the
 *                                  URL begins with "event:". The remainder of
 *                                  the URL after "event:" is placed in the
 *                                  text property of the LINK event.
 *
 *                                  <p><b>Note:</b> The default behavior,
 *                                  adding the text to the text field, occurs
 *                                  only when Flash Player generates the
 *                                  event, which in this case happens when a
 *                                  user attempts to input text. You cannot
 *                                  put text into a text field by sending it
 *                                  <code>textInput</code> events.</p>
 * @event scroll                    Dispatched by a TextField object
 *                                  <i>after</i> the user scrolls.
 * @event textInput                 Flash Player dispatches the

 *                                  enters one or more characters of text.
 *                                  Various text input methods can generate

 *                                  input method editors(IMEs), voice or
 *                                  speech recognition systems, and even the

 *                                  formatting or style information.

	 * Applies the text formatting that the <code>format</code> parameter
	 * specifies to the specified text in a text field. The value of
	 * <code>format</code> must be a TextFormat object that specifies the desired
	 * text formatting changes. Only the non-null properties of
	 * <code>format</code> are applied to the text field. Any property of
	 * <code>format</code> that is set to <code>null</code> is not applied. By
	 * default, all of the properties of a newly created TextFormat object are
	 * set to <code>null</code>.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Note:</b> This method does not work if a style sheet is applied to
	 * the text field.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The <code>setTextFormat()</code> method changes the text formatting
	 * applied to a range of characters or to the entire body of text in a text
	 * field. To apply the properties of format to all text in the text field, do
	 * not specify values for <code>beginIndex</code> and <code>endIndex</code>.
	 * To apply the properties of the format to a range of text, specify values
	 * for the <code>beginIndex</code> and the <code>endIndex</code> parameters.
	 * You can use the <code>length</code> property to determine the index
	 * values.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The two types of formatting information in a TextFormat object are
	 * character level formatting and paragraph level formatting. Each character
	 * in a text field can have its own character formatting settings, such as
	 * font name, font size, bold, and italic.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>For paragraphs, the first character of the paragraph is examined for
	 * the paragraph formatting settings for the entire paragraph. Examples of
	 * paragraph formatting settings are left margin, right margin, and
	 * indentation.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Any text inserted manually by the user, or replaced by the
	 * <code>replaceSelectedText()</code> method, receives the default text field
	 * formatting for new text, and not the formatting specified for the text
	 * insertion point. To set the default formatting for new text, use
	 * <code>defaultTextFormat</code>.</p>
	 * 
	 * @param format A TextFormat object that contains character and paragraph
	 *               formatting information.
	 * @throws Error      This method cannot be used on a text field with a style
	 *                    sheet.
	 * @throws RangeError The <code>beginIndex</code> or <code>endIndex</code>
	 *                    specified is out of range.
